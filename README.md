### Official website:- will be released soon!

---

**Premium Version**: `v7.0.0` (30th October 2020) (Autocatcher uses Artificial Intelligence now!)
  > **The `autocatcher` is now officially fixed and is a Premium Version only feature.**
  It was troublesome fixing this again and again as the open source code is easily readable and patched against. To avoid this in the future, autocatcher is now a Premium feature to make it harder to get. I know that most of you will hate this move, but it was necessary. You guys can continue using the other features like auto-trade and auto-release, etc. which do not really harm anyone.
Thank you all for being patient and sticking around until now.
